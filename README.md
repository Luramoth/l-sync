# L-Sync or, Lura-Sync
A content creator centered synchronisation program, not to be confused with Nvidia's G-Sync

## What is this used for?
This program is made to help with Getting your audio devices and video devices set up and synced by producing a noise and white flash for a quarter of a second

## Build instructions (Linux)
Open up your terminal and paste (or type)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luramoth/l-sync
cd l-sync
```
Then here you can choose to use Cargo or my own personal build script
use `--linux` to compile for linux
use `--windows` to compile for windows
use `--all` to compile for both
append `--release` to compile any of those in release mode

example:
```bash
bash build.sh --linux --release #this builds the program for Linux in release mode
```
